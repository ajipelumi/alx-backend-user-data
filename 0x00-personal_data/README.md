## Personal Data

### Description
This repository contains the code and resources for learning about personal data, and personally identifiable information (PII).

**Personal data** is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual.
Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data.

**Personally identifiable information (PII)** is information that, when used alone or with other relevant data, can identify an individual.
PII includes, but is not limited to, an individual's name, address, phone number, email address, passport number, driver's license number, credit card information, and financial accounts.

The difference between personal data and personally identifiable information is that personal data is a broader term, and includes data that can be used to identify an individual, either directly or indirectly, while personally identifiable information is a more specific subset of personal data, which has to be used to identify an individual.

### Topics Covered

- **Personal Data** - We learn about what personal data is, and how it is different from personally identifiable information (PII).

- **Logging** - We learn about the logging module in Python, and how to use it to log information about our programs.

- **Bcrypt** - We learn about the bcrypt module in Python, and how to use it to hash passwords.
